# 👤 About Me and What I do ________________________________________________________________________________________________

# My name is Simone. I am a professional Frontend Software Engineer.

I possess a profound interest and am diligently refining my expertise in pivotal technologies such as Typescript, ReactJS 
(with its extensive ecosystem including Redux, React Hooks, and Context API), NodeJS, MongoDB, and GraphQL. Throughout my
career, I have collaborated with diverse businesses and nascent startups, bolstering their operations through the development
of robust web applications. When I'm not engrossed in coding or designing, I dedicate time to stay abreast of the latest
development trends,continually honing my professional arsenal.

Beyond the realm of technology, I harbor a fervent passion for photography. Additionally, I am an avid runner, a pursuit I 
undertake not only for physical vigor but also to ensure mental resilience and well-being.
